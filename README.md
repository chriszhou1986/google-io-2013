Google I/O 2013 App Source
==========================

This is the un-official Google I/O 2013 App Source Code hosted on GitHub
(obviously) but [originally hosted on Google Code][1], and pretty much will stay
there (in case you want to follow up on new commits et al - can't really say
it's a mirror since I can't promise to update changes). The app supports devices
running Android 2.3.3+, and is optimized for phones and tablets of all shapes
and sizes.

If you want, you can [download the app here from Google Play][2].
